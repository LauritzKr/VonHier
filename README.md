A university project for a local community platform.

## Installation

To run the project locally, you need to install Python for the backend and Node.js (including NPM) for the frontend. Follow these links to download and install the necessary tools:

- Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Node.js (NPM is included): [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Starting the Backend

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `backend` folder of the project.
3. Install the required packages with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Navigate to the `backend/src` folder of the project.
5. Run the command `python3 main.py` to start the backend server.

### Starting the Frontend

After the backend server is running, start the frontend:

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
3. Install the required packages with `npm ci`.
4. Run the command `npm start` to start the Angular application.

This command starts the Angular application and automatically opens the Chrome browser. The Angular application runs on port 4200 by default. You can access it by entering `http://localhost:4200` in your browser's address bar. Ensure both the backend and frontend are successfully started to use the full functionality of the project.
